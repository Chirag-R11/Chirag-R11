## üìÇ Projects

### 1. **[A SMART HOME APPLIANCES CONTROL SYSTEM BASED ON DIGITAL ELECTRONICS AND GSM NETWORK]()**
   - **Description**: The Smart Home Appliances Control System is an embedded solution designed to remotely control household appliances using Digital Electronics and the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) network. This system leverages a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or PIC) along with a GSM module to allow users to send SMS commands from their mobile phones to switch on/off various appliances like lights, fans, air conditioners, and more.
   - **Features**:
     - Remote Control: Appliances can be switched on or off remotely through SMS commands sent from any mobile phone.
     - Security: The system can integrate security features like door locks, alarms, and surveillance cameras, which can be controlled remotely.
     - Energy Efficiency: Users can ensure that appliances are turned off when not in use, helping save energy.
     - Convenience: The system makes everyday tasks easier, such as turning on lights before entering the house or adjusting the air conditioning remotely.
  - **Technologies Used**:
     - Microcontroller: [Arduino/ESP32]
     - Communication: GSM Module (SIM800L)
     - Control: Relay Module to control home appliances
     - Programming: Embedded C
    
  The combination of digital electronics for appliance control and the GSM network for communication ensures that this system is both efficient and user-friendly, providing an affordable solution for modern smart homes.

### 2. **[Electricity Billing System](https://github.com/Chirag-R11/ElectricityBillingSystem)**
   - **Description**: The Electricity Billing System is a software application developed in Java that automates the process of calculating electricity usage charges for residential or commercial users. This system takes input data such as the units of electricity consumed and user details, and computes the corresponding billing amount based on predefined rates. It simplifies and speeds up the billing process, ensuring accuracy and eliminating the need for manual calculations.
   - **Features**:
     - User Registration and Management: The system allows users to register and manage their details (e.g., name, address, account number).
     - Bill Calculation: The system calculates the bill based on the units of electricity consumed and predefined rate slabs.
     - Bill Generation: Automatically generates a detailed bill for the user, displaying the usage and charges.
     - Reports: Generate and view usage reports or past billing history for users or departments.
  - **Applications**:
     - Utility companies can use such a system to automate the electricity billing process for residential or commercial consumers.
     - The system can be expanded to include features such as online payment integration, multi-user support, and bill history tracking.
   
    This Electricity Billing System is a simple yet efficient tool to automate and simplify the entire billing process, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and convenience for both consumers and utility providers.
